# ChatProject - API

A chat web application project that I've built with Django RestFrameWork for the API and React for the frontend part.

The app allows you to create channels, add friends from the list of users and chat with them in real time.

For this project I didn't use Socket for the real time chat. The function that get the messages is updated every second.

Authentification is done with JWT Authentification that is managed in "api" app.

To install the required packages enter pip install -r requirements.txt in the main folder and npm install in the frontend folder
